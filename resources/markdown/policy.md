## 6. Your Rights

You have the right to:

The Cloud service uses essential cookies for:

- Session management (keeping you logged in)
- CSRF protection (security)
- Theme preferences (light/dark mode)

We do not use tracking cookies or third-party advertising cookies.

## 8. Children

Our services are not directed to children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## 9. AI Connectors / MCP Server

You can authorize an MCP client or AI provider to access your CRM data. The provider receives only data requested through authorized tools. The provider processes that data under its own terms and privacy policy. Disconnecting the provider or revoking its token stops future access.

Relaticle enforces workspace and token scope on every tool request.

**Data tool responses can include:**

- User names, email addresses, and identifiers.
- Team names and identifiers.
- Team-member names, emails, and identifiers.
- Token ability names.
- Companies, people, opportunities, tasks, and notes.
- Record identifiers and canonical record URLs.
- Contact details.
- Custom-field definitions, options, and values.
- Relationships between records.
- Opportunity stages and amounts.
- Activity actors, field changes, and timestamps.
- Record creation and update timestamps.
- Pagination and count metadata.

**What the connector can write.** MCP write tools can change CRM records. They can create, update, delete, and link or unlink companies, people, opportunities, tasks, and notes. Task assignment operations can send transactional notifications.

**OAuth tokens.** When you connect via OAuth (Claude Connectors Directory, ChatGPT App Directory), Relaticle stores an access token and refresh token in the `oauth_access_tokens` and `oauth_refresh_tokens` tables. Access tokens expire after 30 days and refresh tokens after 90 days. You can revoke any connector at any time from **Settings → Access Tokens → AI Connectors**; revocation immediately invalidates both the access and refresh token.

**Personal access tokens.** If you connect using a personal access token created from the Access Tokens page, you control its lifetime. Tokens are hashed at rest. You can revoke individual tokens at any time.

**Conversation data.** The MCP server does not log, store, or process the conversation context of your AI assistant. It only sees the specific tool arguments your assistant sends and the records it requests.

**Response metadata.** Tool responses can include record identifiers, timestamps, pagination metadata, and count metadata.

Tool responses exclude:

- Access tokens.
- Refresh tokens.
- Passwords.
- API keys.
- Authentication secrets.

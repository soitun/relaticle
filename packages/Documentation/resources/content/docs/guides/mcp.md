MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets AI assistants like Claude work directly with your Relaticle CRM data. Instead of copy-pasting between tools, your AI assistant can list companies, create tasks, update contacts, and more -- all from a natural conversation.

---

## What You Can Do

With the Relaticle MCP server, your AI assistant can:

- **List and search** companies, people, opportunities, tasks, and notes
- **Get a single record** with full details and relationships
- **Create new records** directly from a conversation
- **Update existing records** -- rename a company, reassign a task
- **Delete records** you no longer need
- **Attach or detach** tasks and notes to companies, people, and opportunities
- **Read entity schemas** to understand your custom fields
- **Get a CRM overview** with record counts and recent activity

---

## Connect to Relaticle

Clients with OAuth support need only the MCP endpoint. ChatGPT and Claude open Relaticle's consent screen and let you choose one workspace.

Clients without OAuth support need a personal access token:

1. Log in to Relaticle
2. Click your avatar in the top-right corner
3. Select **Access Tokens**
4. Click **Create** and give your token a name
5. Copy the token -- it won't be shown again

The token scopes your access to the workspace you select when creating it. All MCP operations use that workspace's data.

---

## Authentication

Relaticle's MCP server supports two authentication methods:

### OAuth 2.1 (recommended for end users)

The MCP endpoint advertises OAuth metadata at:

- `https://mcp.relaticle.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
- `https://mcp.relaticle.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`

Clients that support Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591), including Claude.ai, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and ChatGPT custom connectors, register themselves automatically and walk you through a one-click consent flow. PKCE is required (`S256`).

At consent you pick **one workspace** for the connector. That choice is permanent for that connector: to point it at a different workspace, revoke it and connect again. Paused workspaces cannot be selected. Subscribe first, or the connector would have no data to read.

Access tokens last 30 days and refresh tokens 90 days; supported clients refresh silently in the background.

### Revoking a connector

**Settings → Access Tokens → AI Connectors** lists every assistant you have connected, the workspace each is bound to, and a **Revoke** button. Revoking invalidates the connector's access and refresh tokens immediately.

### Personal access tokens (recommended for developer tools)

For Cursor, VS Code, MCP Inspector, or any client without OAuth support, create a personal access token from your account settings and pass it as `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`.

---

## Setup by Client

The MCP server endpoint is `https://mcp.relaticle.com`. ChatGPT and Claude use OAuth. The remaining examples use a personal access token.

### ChatGPT

1. Open **Settings → Security and login** and enable **Developer mode**.
2. Open **ChatGPT Plugins** and select the plus button.
3. Enter `Relaticle` and `https://mcp.relaticle.com`.
4. Connect, sign in to Relaticle, and choose one workspace.

### Claude

1. Open **Customize → Connectors**.
2. Select the plus button, then **Add custom connector**.
3. Enter `Relaticle` and `https://mcp.relaticle.com`.
4. Connect, sign in to Relaticle, and choose one workspace.

### Claude Desktop with a personal access token

      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code with a personal access token

Add the server from your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add relaticle \
  --transport streamable-http \
  https://mcp.relaticle.com \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Cursor with a personal access token

Add this to your Cursor MCP configuration (`.cursor/mcp.json`):

      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code with a personal access token

Add this to your VS Code settings (`.vscode/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "relaticle": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://mcp.relaticle.com",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
      }
    }

## Schema Resources

The server exposes five schema resources that describe each entity's fields, including any custom fields your team has configured:

| Resource URI | Description |
|---|---|
| `relaticle://schema/company` | Company fields and custom fields |

Resource support varies by MCP client. Use `get-crm-schema-tool` before a custom-field write when your client does not expose resources automatically.

---

## CRM Overview Prompt

The server includes a built-in prompt called **CRM Overview** that gives your AI assistant a snapshot of your CRM data -- record counts for each entity and recently created companies and people. This is a great starting point for any conversation.

---

## Example Prompts

Once connected, try these in your AI assistant:

- "List all my companies"
- "Create a new company called Acme Corp"
- "Show me the people at company X"
- "Create a task to follow up with John next week"
- "Give me an overview of my CRM"
- "Update the name of company X to Y"
- "Delete the task with ID abc-123"

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized" or 401 Error

Your access token may be expired or invalid. Create a new one from **Settings > Access Tokens**.

### No Data Returned

The MCP server scopes all data to the team associated with your token. Make sure the token was created for the correct team and that the team has data.

### Connection Refused

Verify the MCP URL is correct: `https://mcp.relaticle.com`.

### Custom Fields Not Showing

Custom fields are team-specific. If you don't see them, confirm they're configured for your team in **Settings > Custom Fields**. Then call `get-crm-schema-tool` for the entity type.

### Rate Limiting

MCP tool requests are limited to 120 per minute per authenticated user. OAuth authorization endpoints are limited to 20 per minute per IP address.
